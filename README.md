# Reservation App

A basic reservation app demonstrating Node and Express with jQuery:
* Overall purpose is to help schedule reservation requests.
* Restaurant has just 5 tables available.
* First five requests get a reservation, every request after that is sent to the waiting list.

The application is made of two parts: 
1. A front-end set of HTML/CSS/JS pages for entering and viewing data and 
2. A back-end composed of Node/Express and basic JS for storing, updating, and relaying reservation data.
